## About me 🙌
Hey, what's up? I'm Vishal, currently doing my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering🥲. I'm a big fan of problem-solving and programming 😇, and I'm pretty good at Python. When I'm not hitting the books, you can usually find me on the 🏸 badminton court, smashing the birdie back and forth. I'm also into building diy stuff 🤓 , but let's just say that sometimes things don't go exactly as planned 😑. But hey, that's life🙀, right? I'm all about learning and trying new things🤥, and I'm excited to see where this wild ride takes me.

## 🌱 Currently Learning 🔭
- Java and C#
- Data structures and Algorithms
- Database management and Design concepts 
- SQL to work with relational databases

## ❤️‍🔥 Things I am passionate about 
- Python 
- Game development 🎮
- Open source :octocat:
- Electronics 😑
- Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie 😅 where you are also the murderer.

## More 😮‍💨
